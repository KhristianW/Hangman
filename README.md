# Hangman

Introduction:
- This is a simple hangman java project where you try to guess a word inputted by someone else.
- There is only one class you need to have, or you can just copy the code provided.

The Code:
- In order to have words for you to guess, you need to input words in the wordToGuess String array, you can follow the format of the words that are already inputted for you.

When playing the game:
- You will have only 6 lives for the guesses each life representing the person for the hangman (Head, Body, 2 Arms, and 2 Legs).
- When you run the code for the first time, there will be a message telling you how many letters are in the word (Above your lives).
- Click in the terminal next or under where it says "Please input a letter". you may only input 1 letter at a time.
- If you input multiple letters at one time, it will only pick up the first letter you inputted out of the many letters.
- There is also a message that tells you which letters you have already used in alphabetical order. The "." indicates the letter that is already used.
- If you accidentaly inputted a repeated letter or just did it on purpose to test it out, 1 of 2 things will happen. If the letter is in the word, then nothing happens, you won't lose a life or anything. If the letter isn't in the word, then you will lose a life. (Sorry).
